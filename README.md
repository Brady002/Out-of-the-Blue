<h1>OUT OF THE BLUE (WIP)</h1>
<h2>Important Notes:</h2>
The current build of this game is only in the technical stage. The SampleScene is the only level with full functionality. A dedicated level is currently under development.

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Out of the Blue is an immersive VR game in which you are tasked with piloting a submarine to dredge up scrap and salvage from the depths. The submarine hosts a myriad of features for the player to utilize such as a harpoon to skewer treasure, and a can of sealant to patch up any damage the sub may take along the way</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The submarine requires active player input to be controlled</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic movement controls are on the panel facing the window. The smaller levers are for horizontal movement, while the larger two are for elevation and rotation. Use the side triggers to grab the levers</li>
  <li>Harpoon controls are at the station to your right. Line up the tip of the harpoon to skewer any salvage you might come across, then press the button once to fire, then again to pull the harpoon back.</li>
  <li>To your left is the HUD. It displays important information like the current value of all your collected salvage, and how much oxygen the submarine has left.</li>
  <li>Oxygen can be refilled by piloting the submarine over underwater vents. (WIP) Currently the only penalty for running out of oxygen is visual damage to the hull, however there is no game over condition.</li>
  <li>If your submarine crashes into the terrain it will take damage, draining your oxygen faster. Grab the sealant can beside the harpoon station and hold the main trigger to use it. It takes roughly four seconds to fix a hole in the hull.</li>
</ul>
